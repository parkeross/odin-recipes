    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There's nothing better than a good steak.</p>
    <p>A steak, also sometimes called "beef steak", is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is normally grilled, though it can also be pan-fried. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.</p>

        <li>1 (2-inch) New-York strip loin</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. </li>
